# AdaptiveMCMC

This repository contains my Python codes for the following paper: 
Kiarash Shaloudegi, and András György “[Adaptive MCMC via Combining Local Samplers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03816)”, AISTATS 2019

Please note that this is just an initial version and is distributed without any warranty or responsibility. I will add more details in the future.

### Note: 
In all the experiments, I used the [Information Theoretical Estimators package](https://bitbucket.org/szzoli/ite-in-python/src/default/) of Szabó (2014) to calculate estimates of the Rényi entropy.
